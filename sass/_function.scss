//change text color based on a background color

/*
Designers often choose the text color of an element
based on the background color. If the background is dark,
light text is chosen. If the background is light, they use dark text.
This is because light and dark contrast well with each other and make 
text easier to read.
*/

/*
Here we've used the Sass lightness() function to determine which color
is more appropriate for a background. The lightness() function is
a built-in Sass function that returns the lightness of a color's
RGB value between 0 and 100. Where 0 is the darkest and 100 the lightest.

So in our function we receive a color, and if that color's lightness
value is greater than 50, meaning it's a light color, we return a dark
value to ensure a good contrast. Otherwise we return a light color.
